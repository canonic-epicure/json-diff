            This website hosts an extraction from the <a href="https://siesta.works">Siesta's</a> testing tool codebase -
            a single widget, which provides a deep diff for the 2 pieces of JSON data.
        </p>
        <p>
            The JSON diff is performed by walking both data pieces in-depth, and generating 2 "diff trees", containing the
            information from both left and right sides, so that the representation of the trees aligns horizontally.
            This provides an excellent readability of the diff.
        </p>
        <p>
            Circular references in the JSON data are correctly supported, so in general, this tool support a
            deep diff for the arbitrary JavaScript objects, not just JSON.
            However, right now it's not possible to enter such data.
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope this tool will be useful for someone. If you have found a bug, or have any other feedback, please
